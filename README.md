## About
The purpose of this app is to produce a realistic app by pulling content from a dynamic data source. The topic selected for this app is cocktails. 

The data was retrieved from the [Cocktail DB API](https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/the-cocktail-db), which provides data on alcohol and cocktails. 

The homepage contains five categories: Beer, Cocktails, Cocoa, Punch/Party Drinks and Shots. When the user clicks on a specific category, the app fetches data and displays all beverages within that category. The user can add the beverage to their favourite collection. The user can view their favourite collection under the collections tab and remove any unwanted drink.
